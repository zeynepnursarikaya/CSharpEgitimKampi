# ** 👩🏼‍💻 C# TRAINING CAMP PROJECTS **
This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the C# Training Camp under the guidance of Murat Yücedağ. Each project was an important step in helping me understand specific programming concepts and improve my ability to apply them. Below, you can find the technical details of these projects:
# 🍀 PROJECT 1 - MAİN SUBJECTS
In this project, I learned how to use print commands in C# and work with string and integer variables.
# 🍀 PROJECT 2 - VARİABLES
In this project, I learned how to use double and char variables in C#, take input from the keyboard, and perform operations with variables. 
# 🍀 PROJECT 3 - MAKİNG DECİSİON
In this project, I learned about if-else statements, the modulus operation, and switch-case structures in C#. I applied this knowledge by creating a calculator using the switch-case statement.
# 🍀 PROJECT 4 - LOOPS
In this project, I learned how to use for and while loops.
# 🍀 PROJECT 5 - LOOPS WİTH STARS
In this project, I learned to create various shapes using asterisks (*) with a for loop (e.g., triangle, pyramid, etc.).
# 🍀 PROJECT 6 - ARRAYS
In this project, I learned how to use arrays, print the elements in an array, and perform operations on arrays by taking input from the user.
# 🍀 PROJECT 7 - FOREACH LOOPS

# 🍀 PROJECT 8 - METHODS

# 🍀 PROJECT 9 - DATABASE PROJECT
